# "Try this instead..."

# Front-end:
[ ] - React
[ ] - Vue
[ ] - JS
[ ] - HTML
[ ] - CSS 

# Back-end: 
[ ] - BonAPI 
[ ] - MongoDB
[ ] - Express.js
[ ] - Node.js

# New-tech:
[ ] - Vue.JS
[ ] - read the docs 
[ ] - watch Youtube tutorials
[ ] - Look into Udemy course (if it isn't pricey and I can't grasp the content with the above resources)

# Models:
[ ] - Users 
[ ] - Recipes 
[ ] - Ingredients

# MVP:
[ ] - form that allows user to input ingredient they can't have 
[ ] - query API to return an ingredient that could replace form submitted ingredient 
[ ] - front end that is mobile friendly 
[ ] - dummy data for a user 

# Stretch:
[ ] - users are involved - create auth and user profile/login
[ ] - the ability for users to save recommendations and rate them
[ ] - users can share recommendations with friends 

# App-inspo:
[ ] - I often find myself or my friends having a hard time finding reasonable substitutes for ingredients that we are either allergic to, or are unable to digest well 
[ ] - I think a lot of people struggle with knowing what is out there and often gravitate towards what isn't always the "best" option since it's more readily available/advertised
[ ] - My ideal user would be someone that suffers from an allergy to specific ingredients like Peanuts, Dairy, Gluten, and even the unique allergies like Melons, Potatoes, Rice, etc. 

# Foreseeable roadblocks:
[ ] - Biting off more than I can chew! 
[ ] - Not being able to complete the entire app before it's due 
[ ] - Not having enough documentation on Vue or the API to properly implement either one
